decrease in income, or increased expenses, or even unemployment. In such a case, it becomes 
imperative to keep track of one's finances to make informed and calculated decisions about 
their own spendings and savings and to plan, how to efficiently manage finances to safely 
maneuver an economic crisis. This means that to adapt to such a crisis, having a clear and 
complete understanding about income, expenses, savings and following a budget plan is

management features can be especially helpful in an economic crisis. By providing a
